The <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Carpentries</a> is a volunteer organisation teaching foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.

  <a href="{{site.uio_site}}">Carpentry@UiO</a>
  aims to help anyone willing to learn how to get work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and give you an overview of how to make use of climate data for a wide range of applications. 
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
